# Rules

Keep these tight. Iris should obey these.

## Risk
- Max position size: ____% of bankroll
- Max daily loss: ____%
- Never average down unless explicitly allowed

## Entries
- No buying the top (define what "top" means)
- Prefer clean liquidity
- Avoid obvious paid shills

## Exits
- Scale out into strength
- Use invalidation as a hard stop

## Learning
- If a trade loses: write *why* and what changes
- If a trade wins: write what signal mattered most
